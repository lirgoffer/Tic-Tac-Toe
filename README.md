# Tic-Tac-Toe
Developed an X-circle game in C++ showcasing strong principles of programming, notably encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Utilized a class-based structure with inter-class relationships (e.g., Board including Cell) for efficient management of game elements. The inclusion principle is evident in dynamically allocating memory, ensuring clean destruction in destructors, and validating moves for legality and occupancy. The implementation emphasizes modularity and readability, fostering a robust and extensible codebase.
